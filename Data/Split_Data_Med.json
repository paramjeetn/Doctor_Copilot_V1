        "content": "The document outlines the diagnostic criteria and classification for diabetes, emphasizing various tests such as the A1C, where a level of ≥6.5% indicates diabetes; the 2-hour glucose value during an oral glucose tolerance test with a threshold of ≥200 mg/dL for diabetes; fasting plasma glucose, where diabetes is diagnosed at ≥126 mg/dL; and random glucose testing, which diagnoses diabetes at ≥200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms. It notes the limitations of continuous glucose monitoring in diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes, and the necessity for confirmatory testing in ambiguous cases. The classification section details different types of diabetes including Type 1, Type 2, gestational, and other causes such as genetic syndromes. Screening is recommended for adults based on risk factors, with specific guidelines for assessing risks such as age, prior gestational diabetes, and other health conditions. Clinical notes suggest repeat screening every three years for normal results, and more frequently for those with prediabetes or changing symptoms. Special circumstances, like hemoglobin variants or post-transplant status, may alter screening methods, with various specific tests recommended based on the individual's condition and risk factors."

Screening is recommended to be done safely and cost-effectively, targeting individuals with prediabetes annually and others every three years, beginning from puberty or age 10 in at-risk youths. Diet recommendations promote a healthy eating pattern that includes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and minimal processed foods, with various diet styles like Mediterranean and DASH highlighted. Physical activity should be moderate and regular, aiming for at least 150 minutes per week. High-risk adults should be referred to recognized diabetes prevention programs. Metformin is noted as the most supported pharmacological prevention for high-risk individuals, although not FDA-approved for this purpose. Screening for Type 1 diabetes involves monitoring autoantibodies and glycemic metrics. Teplizumab-mzwv is mentioned for delaying Type 1 diabetes in specific stages.

This flowchart provides a guideline on how to proceed with fibrosis risk assessment in patients using initial noninvasive testing and determining the need for further evaluation or routine monitoring based on risk levels. Management Weight loss with intensive lifestyle therapy and/or metabolic surgery, as appropriate, is recommended. Pioglitazone and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are the preferred agents for treatment of hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and NASH, unless decompensated cirrhosis is present. People with type 2 diabetes and decompensated cirrhosis from NASH should be treated with insulin. Statin therapy is safe in the setting of NAFLD."

Hypoglycemia Assessment, Prevention, and Treatment Hypoglycemia is categorized into three levels based on blood glucose concentrations and symptom severity. Level 1 is glucose <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) but ≥54 mg/dL (≥3.0 mmol/L). Level 2 is glucose <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L). Level 3 is a severe event characterized by altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance for treatment of hypoglycemia, irrespective of glucose level. Assessment and medication selection i) Review hypoglycemia history at every clinical encounter in all at-risk individuals. ii) Screen for impaired hypoglycemia awareness in all at-risk individuals. iii) Consider hypoglycemia risk when selecting diabetes medications and setting glycemic goals. Prevention and management of hypoglycemia i) Use CGM for individuals at high risk for hypoglycemia."

        "content": "The approach to managing diabetes in older adults is differentiated by their health status, ranging from healthy individuals to those at the end of life, with tailored A1C goals to match each scenario. For healthy older adults, the target A1C is below 7-7.5%, while more complex cases with multiple chronic illnesses or cognitive impairments aim for less stringent targets like <8.0%. Treatment in skilled nursing facilities focuses on maintaining glucose levels between 100–200 mg/dL, avoiding strict A1C adherence. In very complex or poor health situations, the focus shifts from A1C levels to preventing hypoglycemia and managing symptomatic hyperglycemia, emphasizing comfort. Medication strategies are adapted to the individual’s ability to manage diabetes, with options to simplify or intensify regimens based on changes in health status, hypoglycemia risk, and overall treatment goals. Continuous glucose monitoring and other technologies are considered to reduce hypoglycemia, alongside medications that address cardiovascular risks irrespective of glycemic control. This patient-centered approach prioritizes flexible treatment goals to enhance quality of life and reduce treatment burdens in older adults."

Simplification of Complex Insulin Therapy 1. Individual on Basal (Long- or Intermediate-acting) and/or Prandial (Short- or Rapid-acting) Insulins: Basal Insulin Adjustments: Change timing from bedtime to morning. Titrate dose of basal insulin based on fasting finger-stick glucose test results over a week: If fasting goal is 90-150 mg/dL, consider adjusting goals based on overall health and goals of care. If 50% of fasting values are above goal, increase dose by 2 units. If 2+ fasting values per week are <80 mg/dL, decrease dose by 2 units. Prandial Insulin Adjustments: If prandial insulin >10 units/dose, decrease dose by 50% and consider adding noninsulin agents."

Individual on Premixed Insulin: Use 70% of the total dose as basal insulin only in the morning. If mealtime insulin ≤10 units/dose: Discontinue prandial insulin and add noninsulin agent(s). Additional Pathways and Tips: Adding Noninsulin Agents: If eGFR is ≥45 mg/dL, start metformin 500 mg daily and increase dose every 2 weeks as tolerated. If eGFR is <45 mg/dL and patient is already taking metformin or metformin is not tolerated, proceed to second-line agents. General Guidelines: Do not use rapid- and short-acting insulin at bedtime. Use a simplified sliding scale for adjusting prandial insulin based on premeal glucose levels. Stop sliding scale when not needed daily. Additional Recommendations Based on Comprehensive Care Guidelines: Use individual and drug characteristics to guide decision-making."

Effective management includes collaboration with specialized diabetes teams, using validated order sets, and assessing diabetes type and self-management capabilities upon admission. Perioperative care specifies maintaining A1C below 8% and blood glucose between 100–180 mg/dL within four hours of surgery, with adjustments in medications like metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors, and tailored insulin therapy. Transitioning from hospital to home requires a structured discharge plan that encompasses diabetes education, medication reconciliation, and scheduling follow-up visits to reduce readmissions and ensure continuity of care. Strategies such as treating high A1C levels with insulin and implementing transitional care models are employed to further decrease the likelihood of readmissions."

Preconception counseling is crucial, starting at puberty and focusing on achieving optimal A1C levels below 6.5% to minimize pregnancy complications. Continuous glucose monitoring and frequent blood glucose measurements guide glycemic management with targets set to reduce hyperglycemia without risking significant hypoglycemia. For GDM, identified typically in the second half of pregnancy in previously non-diabetic individuals, lifestyle changes and insulin are recommended, while oral medications are generally avoided due to safety concerns. Postpartum care includes psychological support, screening for diabetes, and adjusting diabetes therapies to account for changes in insulin sensitivity after delivery.

For Type 2 diabetes, injectable therapies like GLP-1 receptor agonists or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists are preferred over insulin initially due to their benefits on glycemic control, weight management, and cardiovascular risk. Insulin therapy is recommended in cases of significant hyperglycemia or catabolic symptoms, and can be combined with GLP-1 for enhanced efficacy.
