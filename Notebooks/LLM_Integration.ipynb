For healthy older adults, the target A1C is below 7-7.5%, while more complex cases with multiple chronic illnesses or cognitive impairments aim for less stringent targets like <8.0%. Treatment in skilled nursing facilities focuses on maintaining glucose levels between 100–200 mg/dL, avoiding strict A1C adherence. In very complex or poor health situations, the focus shifts from A1C levels to preventing hypoglycemia and managing symptomatic hyperglycemia, emphasizing comfort. Medication strategies are adapted to the individual’s ability to manage diabetes, with options to simplify or intensify regimens based on changes in health status, hypoglycemia risk, and overall treatment goals. Continuous glucose monitoring and other technologies are considered to reduce hypoglycemia, alongside medications that address cardiovascular risks irrespective of glycemic control.
